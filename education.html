        <h1>The Present</h1>
        <p>Currently, I am a student at the University of ALberta majoring in both mathamatics and computing science <br/>
            with an interest in data analysis and how computers can best be used to interperet data. But I am open to trying new
            <br/> things! Computing Science in particular is a field with many facets, and they are all fascinating
            to explore.

        <h1>The Past</h1>
        <p>In September of 2019 I embarked on a study abroad term to the beautiful city of Belfast, in Northern
            <br/>Ireland. I had the opportunity to study at Queen's University Belfast, travel, and make lots of 
            new friends <br/> from around the world. It was invaluable, and the improvisation and resilience
            I learned I will take with me forever. Although it was terrifying initially, I am so glad I went.
