    <p>Currently, I am a student at the University of ALberta majoring in both mathamatics and computing science <br/>
    with an interest in data analysis and how computers can best be used to interperet data. But I am open to trying new
    <br/> things! Computing Science in particular is a field with many facets, and they are all fascinating
    to explore.</p>
