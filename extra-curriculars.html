        <h1>When I'm Not at School</h1>
        <h4>Hackathons</h4>
        <h6>DigiEduHack Belfast: September 2019</h6>
        <p>My first Hackathon. We were tasked with creating a pitch for the implementation of one of two concepts.
            My group created a pitch for an app that tracks the food in your cupboard and how best to use it. The main 
            challenges here were the fact that there was no progamming being done, it was all theoretical, as the event was 
            only in the evening, and so it was much more theoretical than practical. Still, it was excellent practice at collaborating
            with strangers and trying to find the best implementation for the application.
        </p>
        <h6>Artificial Intelligence Norther Ireland Datathon: October 2019</h6>
        <p>The goal here was to take one of the sample data sets provided by the sponsors and to tell a story with the data.
            My group took a data set reporting on mental health statistics in the technology industry, and after cleaning up the data 
            analyzed the ways in which the statistics varied by state in the United States of America. We also created a visualization
            in Power BI, and had to create a video explaining our findings. We ended up winning our division, thanks to the wonderful teamwork
            and enthusiasm each of us on that team had.
        </p>
        <h6>HACKed: January 2020</h6>
        <p>For this hackathon we were not given any guidelines in terms of what kind of project to create. As a result, 
            we came up with the concept of a messaging service that is able to send messages in one language and recieve them 
            in another, which would be especially useful in stimulating international converstaions. We struggled for quite some 
            time in getting the Google Translation and Messaging API's to function properly on our machines, and so as a result 
            were ultimately unsuccessul in creating a functioning finished project. In the future, I want to determine what went
            wrong with this implementation, and ultimately create a finished product that works as intended. As a result of attempting
            this, however, I learned more about collaborating with other programmers through GitHub, dividing work by functionality, and 
            the ways in which API's can be indispensible as a programmer. These are skills I want to use in future projects, to make
            something really fascinating.

        <h4>Capital Care</h4>
        <p>Since October of 2018, I have been visiting the Capital Care facility
            near my house to visit one of the residents. She is wheelchair bound and non-verbal,
            and is also incredibly sweet and friendly. I visit her every Sunday, and together we read 
            the last two <u>Harry Potter</u> books as well as William Goldman's adaptation of 
            <u>The Princess Bride</u>. Communication is sometimes difficult, but it is simply a matter of patience and
            asking the right questions, such that she can answer them with her communication board. If I can help her 
            in any way, I will find a way to do it.
        </p>
        <h4>Programming Projects</h4>
        <h6>This Website</h6>
        <p>This website was created when I learned that GitHub had free hosting services for websites. It was
            a matter of simply refreshing my knowledge of HTML, as GitHub provides themes to use. In the future, I 
            will likely try to learn more CSS so as to make a theme myself and really personalize it. The GitHub
            repository for this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/eskousbol/eskousbol.github.io">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h6>Calculus Calculator</h6>
        <p>As a means to get moving and to keep my calculus knowledge sharp, I have started creating
            a calculator using Python version 3 that will accept some polynomial and return it's first order 
            derivative. It is an excellent exercise in really thinking about each of the steps involved in differentiation,
            and in figuring out how to explain such concepts in a way the computer can understand, although chalenges
            do arise when thinking about the polynomial in terms of a string rather than a function. This calculator 
            can be found on my GitHub account, linked <a href="https://github.com/eskousbol/Calculator">here</a>.
