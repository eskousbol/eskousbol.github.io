        <h1>What I do when I'm not in School</h1>
        <h4>Capital Care</h4>
        <p>Since October of 2018, I have been visiting the Capital Care facility
            near my house to visit one of the residents. She is wheelchair bound and non-verbal,
            and is also incredibly sweet and friendly. I visit her every Sunday, and together we read 
            the last two <u>Harry Potter</u> books as well as William Goldman's adaptation of 
            <u>The Princess Bride</u>.

        <h6>This Website</h6>
        <p>This website was created when I learned that GitHub had free hosting services for websites. It was
            a matter of simply refreshing my knowledge of HTML, as GitHub provides themes to use. In the future, I 
            will likely try to learn more CSS so as to make a theme myself and really personalize it. The GitHub
            repository for this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/eskousbol/eskousbol.github.io">here</a>.

        <h6>Calculus Calculator</h6>
        <p>As a means to get moving and to keep my calculus knowledge sharp, I have started creating
            a calculator using Python version 3 that will accept some polynomial and return it's first order 
            derivative. It is an excellent exercise in really thinking about each of the steps involved in differentiation,
            and in figuring out how to explain such concepts in a way the computer can understand. This calculator 
            can be found on my GitHub account, linked <a href="https://github.com/eskousbol/Calculator">here</a>.
