        <h1>Emily: The Person</h1>
        <p>Alright, I've spent a lot of time talking about what I do for school what activities I do, but I
            would like to take this opportunity to say a little bit about myself and what I do for fun
            that does not have hours recorded.
        </p>
        <p>I would say, if I had to describe myself quickly, that I am honest, loyal, and kind to a fault.
             I like helping people, and I like using the skills I have developed to help people. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, when I'm not solving calculus problems or programming, I really like to bake. And I'm pretty good at it,
            too. Cookies, cakes, pastries of all kinds. It is a practice with a wonderful result, and to share
            with those around me is one of the best parts. I like painting with watercolours. I really enjoy listening to 
            comedy podcasts, they make my long commute to the university substantially better.
